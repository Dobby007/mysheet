This is a simple TODO list. 
Features that are marked with dash symbol are not yet implemented. 
On the other hand, features marked with asterisk are already implemented.

[-] Implement support of unary operators
[-] Make so that arithmetic expression was recognized correctly when operators are not separated by spaces
[-] Enhance support of plugins: make so that plugins can register it's own MssClass and ParserExtension in user defined precedence
